# I have started to develope and design this when I was voluntarily working for community development in Slovakia during very first days of the pandemia. 

I was inspired to make this App amid working for CERVENY KRIZ/SLOVENSKO RED CROSS..


This App allows you add donors, edit them; check the lists and edit them. Thanks to Data Binding between data-tables, It makes it very easy, respectively, to register
a patient, check the availablitiy of stocks, search for needed group of blood and donate them.

It is fully functioning and developing for the best :)
I will be developing and accelerate it in the time...
